# Q5. Write a Python program to find Fibonacci Sequence?

def fibonacci(n): 
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]  # Initialize the sequence with the first two terms 

    for i in range(2, n): 
        next_term = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] 
        fib_sequence.append(next_term)

num_terms = 10
